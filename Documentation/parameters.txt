LegoOS parameters

	earlyprintk=	[X86]
			earlyprintk=serial[,ttySn[,baudrate]]
			earlyprintk=serial[,0x...[,baudrate]]
			earlyprintk=ttySn[,baudrate]
			earlyprintk=dbgp[debugController#]
			earlyprintk=pciserial,bus:device.function[,baudrate]

			earlyprintk is useful when the kernel crashes before
			the normal console is initialized. It is not enabled by
			default because it has some cosmetic problems.

			Append ",keep" to not disable it when the real console
			takes over.

			Only one of vga, efi, serial, or usb debug port can
			be used at a time.

			Currently only ttyS0 and ttyS1 may be specified by
			name.  Other I/O ports may be explicitly specified
			on some architectures (x86 and arm at least) by
			replacing ttySn with an I/O port address, like this:
				earlyprintk=serial,0x1008,115200
			You can find the port for a given device in
			/proc/tty/driver/serial:
				2: uart:ST16650V2 port:00001008 irq:18 ...

			Interaction with the standard serial driver is not
			very good.

	apic=		[APIC] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
			Change the output verbosity whilst booting
			Format: { quiet (default) | verbose | debug }
			Change the amount of debugging information output
			when initialising the APIC and IO-APIC components.

	early_ioremap_debug
			Enable to print early_ioremap() debug information.
			This may generate a mount of messages, you are warned.

	smpboot_verbosity=
			[X86]
			smpboot_verbosity=debug
			Enable to print info from arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c
