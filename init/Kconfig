config ARCH
	string
	option env="ARCH"

config KERNELVERSION
	string
	option env="KERNELVERSION"


config CROSS_COMPILE
	string "Cross-compiler tool prefix"
	help
	  Same as running 'make CROSS_COMPILE=prefix-' but stored for
	  default make runs in this kernel build directory.  You don't
	  need to set this unless you want the configured kernel build
	  directory to select the cross-compiler automatically.

config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version - append to kernel release"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of your kernel version.
	  This will show up when you type uname, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO
	bool "Automatically append version information to the version string"
	default n
	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for git tags that belong to the current
	  top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  (The actual string used here is the first eight characters produced
	  by running the command:

	    $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD

	  which is done within the script "scripts/setlocalversion".)

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Built-in kernel command line"
	---help---
	  Allow for specifying boot arguments to the kernel at
	  build time.  On some systems (e.g. embedded ones), it is
	  necessary or convenient to provide some or all of the
	  kernel boot arguments with the kernel itself (that is,
	  to not rely on the boot loader to provide them.)

	  To compile command line arguments into the kernel,
	  set this option to 'Y', then fill in the
	  boot arguments in CONFIG_CMDLINE.

	  Systems with fully functional boot loaders (i.e. non-embedded)
	  should leave this option set to 'N'.

config CMDLINE
	string "Built-in kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default ""
	---help---
	  Enter arguments here that should be compiled into the kernel
	  image and used at boot time.  If the boot loader provides a
	  command line at boot time, it is appended to this string to
	  form the full kernel command line, when the system boots.

	  In most cases, the command line (whether built-in or provided
	  by the boot loader) should specify the device for the root
	  file system.

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly
	  larger and slower, but it gives very useful debugging information
	  in case of kernel bugs. (precise oopses/stacktraces/warnings)
