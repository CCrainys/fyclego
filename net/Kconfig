	  lwip TCP/IP layer.

config FIT
	bool "FIT IB layer"
	default y
	depends on INFINIBAND

config FIT_MAX_OUTSTANDING_SEND
	int "Max outstanding send requests"
	range 1 24
	default 1  if COMP_PROCESSOR
	default 24 if COMP_MEMORY
	depends on FIT
	help
	  This determines the maximum number of concurrent outstanding
	  reply SEND. (reply is also a SEND.)
	  
	  For processor, 1 is good enough. Because it is major doing SEND.
	  For memory, we tune it to be the number of cores. Our machine
	  has 24 cores, so 24 it is.

	  If unsure, follow default.

config FIT_DEBUG
	bool "Enable fit_debug"
	default n
	depends on FIT
	help
	  Enable to enable fit_debug() marco

config FIT_SEQUENTIAL_IBAPI
	bool "Make ibapi sequentially executed"
	default n
	depends on FIT
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option will make ibapi_send_reply() sequentially executed.
	  This is achieved by adding a lock to protec the function.

	  If unsure say N.

config FIT_INITIAL_SLEEP_TIMEOUT
	int "FIT initial sleep timeout (s) for connection"
	default 10
	depends on FIT
	help
	  This is the time you need to wait for FIT to establish
	  connection with other machines. Life is short, make it smaller.

config FIT_NR_NODES
	int "FIT Number of Connected Nodes"
	default 2
	depends on FIT
	help
	  This is the number of nodes that can be connected by FIT layer.
	  Count the nodes you need for testing, and then set the EXACT same
	  value for all the testing nodes.

	  E.g., if you are going to use 4 nodes, then config it as 4.

config FIT_LOCAL_ID
	int "FIT Unique Local ID [0, FIT_NR_NODES)"
	depends on FIT || FIT_NR_NODES
	help
	  This is the local node id, which has to be unique across connected FIT nodes.
	  The raneg of FIT_LOCAL_ID is [0, FIT_NR_NODES - 1).

config FIT_NOWAIT
	bool "FIT use nowait"
	default n
	depends on FIT
	depends on COMP_MEMORY
	help
	  Disable this when encountering some unreasonable package lost

	default n
	depends on FIT

config SOCKET_O_IB
	bool "IB support of Socket"
	default n
	depends on FIT
	help
	  Enable if you want to have socket APIs built over Infiniband.
	  You must enable this on ALL nodes if you want the cluster to support socket.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SOCKET_SYSCALL
	bool "Socket SYSCALL Support"
	default y if COMP_PROCESSOR
	default n if COMP_MEMORY
	depends on SOCKET_O_IB
	help
	  Enable if you need socket SYSCALL on the node. Only processor component
	  can enable this config since that is the only one will run user program.

	  You must enable this if you want to use socket syscall.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SOCKET_SERVER
	bool "socket server test code"
	default n
	depends on SOCKET_SYSCALL
	help
	  Enable to test socket server during boot.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SOCKET_CLIENT
	bool "socket server test code"
	default n
	depends on SOCKET_SYSCALL
	help
	  Enable to test socket client during boot.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Turn on to show socket syscall implementation debugging msgs

config EPOLL
	bool "epoll system call support"
	default n
	depends on SOCKET_SYSCALL
	help
	  Enable to use epoll on socket. Only processor components that have socket
	  support should enable this config. Epoll for other file types are not 
	  supported now.

config DEBUG_EPOLL
