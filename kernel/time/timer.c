 * schedule_timeout - sleep until timeout
 * @timeout: timeout value in jiffies
 *
 * Make the current task sleep until @timeout jiffies have
 * elapsed. The routine will return immediately unless
 * the current task state has been set (see set_current_state()).
 *
 * You can set the task state as follows -
 *
 * %TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE - at least @timeout jiffies are guaranteed to
 * pass before the routine returns unless the current task is explicitly
 * woken up, (e.g. by wake_up_process())".
 *
 * %TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE - the routine may return early if a signal is
 * delivered to the current task or the current task is explicitly woken
 * up.
 *
 * The current task state is guaranteed to be TASK_RUNNING when this
 * routine returns.
 *
 * Specifying a @timeout value of %MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT will schedule
 * the CPU away without a bound on the timeout. In this case the return
 * value will be %MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT.
 *
 * Returns 0 when the timer has expired otherwise the remaining time in
 * jiffies will be returned.  In all cases the return value is guaranteed
 * to be non-negative.
