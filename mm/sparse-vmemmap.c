/*
 * Virtual Memory Map support
 *
 * Virtual memory maps allow VM primitives pfn_to_page, page_to_pfn,
 * virt_to_page, page_address() to be implemented as a base offset
 * calculation without memory access.
 *
 * However, virtual mappings need a page table and TLBs. Many Linux
 * architectures already map their physical space using 1-1 mappings
 * via TLBs. For those arches the virtual memory map is essentially
 * for free if we use the same page size as the 1-1 mappings. In that
 * case the overhead consists of a few additional pages that are
 * allocated to create a view of memory for vmemmap.
 *
 * The architecture is expected to provide a vmemmap_populate() function
 * to instantiate the mapping.
